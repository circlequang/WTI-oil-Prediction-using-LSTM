The above code is used to predict the closing price of an asset (in this case, WTI oil) using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. This is a type of deep recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically designed to handle and predict time series data. Below is a detailed description of the principles and purpose of the code:

**Purpose:**
- Predict Closing Prices: Use historical closing price data of WTI oil to train a model and then predict future closing prices.
- Evaluate Model: Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the performance of the prediction model.
  
**Working Principles:**
1. Read and Process Data:
- The code begins by reading data from a CSV file containing information on WTI oil prices.
- The data is converted to a datetime format and sorted in chronological order.

2. Dataset:
- The dataset contains closing prices from 2002-02-07 to 2024-02-13, totaling 5518 rows of data. This amount of data is relatively suitable for training.

3. Split Data:
- The data is split into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%).

4. Create Dataset:
- The create_dataset function is used to create pairs of data (X, y) from the time series, where X is a subsequence of the data and y is the next value in the sequence.
- This helps the model learn to predict the next value based on previous values.
- The model uses the last 10 closing prices to predict the next closing price.

5. Prepare Data:
- The data is reshaped to fit the input of the LSTM model, which requires data in the format [samples, time steps, features].

6. Build and Train LSTM Model:
- An LSTM model is built with two stacked LSTM layers and one Dense layer for the output.
- The model is compiled using the mean_squared_error loss function and the adam optimizer.
- The model is trained on the training data with a specified number of epochs and batch size.

7. Prediction and Evaluation:
- After training, the model is used to predict on the test data.
- The predicted results and the actual values are printed for comparison.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

8. Display Results:
- A plot of actual prices and predicted prices is generated to visualize the model's performance.

**Overview:**
The main purpose of the code is to build a deep learning model to predict future values of an asset based on past data. Using LSTM helps the model capture long-term dependencies in the time series data, which is crucial for predicting financial asset prices. However, it's important to note that a model that performs well in predicting WTI oil prices might not perform equally well for other assets such as forex, crypto, or different stocks due to the unique characteristics of each asset class.
